Message for Juniors: Hello All, I can't believe that I am going to join Data Society as a Data Scientist.
But It all happened due to the whole Ineuron team and the super-power available for all of us, yes you guessed it right (Internet).
I still remember when I started my journey into the data field I was so afraid of coding and logic building, but as time passed away 
I was like just keep practicing and follow the best practices, and the best advice that my mentor is giving. I would like to thank
Mr. Sudhanshu Kumar, Krish Naik and Dhaval Patel (Codebasics). These guys are simply awesome. So much legitimate contents are available
on youtube regarding data science due to Krish Naik and Dhaval Patel. I learned from them very much but when I joined Inueron I came to
know how we can build industry(Production) grade Projects. Overall I want to say that if I can become a data scientist,
I think anybody who loves the field of data and process and not the outcome only, he/she definitely become more successful in the field
of Data Science.

Message for Juniors: Hi, I am a Saurabh, completed my bachelor's in Petroleum Engineering in 2021. After completing my graduation,
I joined an IT Consulting firm and worked there for 1 year but my inclination from the beginning was towards ML/Data analytics or in simple words
playing around with the data and programming. One day I saw Sudhanshu and Krish Sir's videos on youtube. After seeing that I purchased the ML
masters course from iNeuron.ai (on the canvas platform). After completing that course I started giving interviews, I was able to clear ML-related
questions but I was stuck when questions were asked on a big data-related topic. Then I purchased a Big Data course by Saurav Agarwal sir.
After completing that I started giving interviews and I gave around 7-8 interviews 2 months back, out of which I was able to get the offer from
5 (Business analyst, Data Analyst, Business operation analyst, Python developer, and last but not least Data Engineer). I was just in flow and
continuously giving the interviews and in the end, I was able to clear all the profiles. The way Sudhanshu sir teaches is just amazing, it gives
me the confidence that in an interview I told to an interviewer to ask anything about any ML algorithm. I recommend everyone if they really want to
excel in the field of AI/ML/Data engineering and don't have an idea where to start, just start with iNeuron.ai, because here you not only get
the theoretical concept clear but also do the practical implementation of the concepts. Thanks
